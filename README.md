# ajs-1.4---form-fun

**Advanced JavaScript | Lecture 1 Task 4**

Write a script to retrieve text that the user types in the textarea and display it in the page as HTML.
This will occur after the user clicks the form button.

Additionally, after you have added their text to the page, you will remove the text from the textarea so that the user can enter more text and repeat the process.

Extra challenge: Currently, if the user types nothing in the textarea, but clicks the button, our code adds an empty paragraph to the page! Can you resolve this issue? â€¢ i.e. only take action in the event handler if text has been entered.
